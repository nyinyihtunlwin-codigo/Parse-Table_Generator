# Parse-Table_Generator
A parser automation system used by top-down parsing technique.

### Overview of the System

This system	 is a parser automation system used by top-down parsing technique. Based on user input CFG, this system can automatically determine whether the input grammar is backtrack-free grammar. If the parser determines that input CFG is backtrack-free grammar, it can automatically build appropriate parse table. If the parser determines that the input CFG is not backtrack-free grammar, it reports the problem and appropriate information to the user. Based on the input CFG, this system show the user how a compilerâ€™s parser (Top-down parser) works step by step.
